GigHub is mini social network that makes it really easy for live music lovers to track the gigs of their favorite artists.

Artists can sign up and list their  gigs. When adding a gig they should specify the date/time, location and genre of the gig.

An artist should have a page called My Upcomming Gigs. From there they should be able to edit or remove an exising gig or add 
another gig to the list.

Users should be able to view all upcomming gigs or search them by artist, genre or location. They should be able to view details
of a gig and add it to their calender.

Additionally users should follow their favorite artists. When they follow an artist, they should see the upcomming gigs of their 
favorite artists in the gig feed.
